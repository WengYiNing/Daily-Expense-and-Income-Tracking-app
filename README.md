# Daily-Expense-and-Income-Tracking-app

## Introduction

In this project, we have created a program focused on personal finance management. Recognizing the significance of financial management in everyoneâ€™s life, particularly during the college years, our program addresses the various financial aspects that impact our quality of life and future planning. 

Throughout the college journey, individuals contend with expenses such as tuition, accommodation, food, textbooks, and other living costs. The effective management of finances becomes crucial, not only for meeting immediate needs but also for preparing for future careers after graduation. 

Through this program, our goal is to provide a tool that aids in monitoring expense records, fostering financial awareness, and facilitating prudent money management for a more secure and successful future.

-  **Text and FloatText Input**
    -  Widgets.Text: Used for textual input (e.g., expense category).
    -  Widgets.FloatText: Used for numerical input (e.g., ex- pense amount).
-  **Matplotlib for Data Visualization**
    -  Plt. subplots, ax. pie: Matplotlib functions are used for creating a pie chart to visualize expense categories and amounts.
-  **List (expense categories, expense amounts)**
    -  Python lists are used to store expense categories and amounts.
-  **Event Handling Functions**
    -  Functions are defined to handle button clicks and perform specific actions (e.g., on record button click, record expense).
-  **String Formatting**
    -  String formatting is used to display total expenses in the pie chart.
    
Overall, the code utilizes a variety of data types, including widgets, lists, and styles, to create a functional and visually appealing expense tracking program. The integration of Matplotlib allows for dynamic data visualization, enhancing the user experience.
